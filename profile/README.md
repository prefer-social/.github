## prefer.social ðŸ‘‹

Prefer.social is an ActivityPub-based social network platform built on top of WebAssembly and the WebAssembly System Interface.

You may have been redirected from https://prefer.social. We don't have a dedicated page yet, but instead, we redirected you to the source repositories.

Its main service frontend `kite` is under AGPL, and many of its modules are either AGPL or Apache 2.0 (or with MIT) licensed.

A very minimal introduction but busy writing code instead of creating a fancy webpage.
